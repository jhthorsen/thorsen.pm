# thorsen.pm

The code in this repository is responsible for rendering
[thorsen.pm](https://thorsen.pm).

It supports rendering [tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/)
(Jinja2) powered templates as well as markdown.

The web-server can also serve static files, and has some
endpoints that fetch data from third parties.

This is my second Rust project, and I think it's so much
fun!

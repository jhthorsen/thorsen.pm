I live and breathe web technologies. I have about a hundred projects on
[Github](https://github.com/jhthorsen), many libraries for developers, but also
some web applications and command line tools. My two most successful libraries
are [JSON Validator](https://github.com/jhthorsen/json-validator/), and the
accommodating
[OpenAPI](https://github.com/jhthorsen/mojolicious-plugin-openapi/) module.

Want to know more about me? Check out my [curriculum vitae](/curriculum-vitae.html)
or have a look at my projects below. Want to get in touch? Send me an

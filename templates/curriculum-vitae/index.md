### Rust and Go

Since early 2024 I’ve been fortunate to program in Go and Rust. The webpage you
are visiting now is written in Rust.

### Perl

### Other

## Personal interests

My main interest is programming, both in frontend and backend. I like to learn
new things about API design, but also design principles regarding frontend
development. I also like to take a walk, jog or go skiing. Whenever I can, I
travel to meet new people and experience new places.

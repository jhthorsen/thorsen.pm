# SNMP::Effective

[19th of February,

I'm done writing the code for SNMP::Effective now. It has show to be
quite promising after some tests: 4000 hosts in 50 seconds is quite
better than what I had with a previous module. I'm hoping to release
SNMP::Effective on [CPAN](http://cpan.org), later this year. But first I
need to complete [eAdmin
2.0](http://www.google.com/search?q=eadmin%20eidolon%20as)

In the meanwhile, you could try
[SNMP::Multi](http://search.cpan.org/~tpg/SNMP-Multi), which gave me the
idea to write my own.

[I've managed to
get](http://home.thorsen.pm/gallery/screenshot/xgl-1.png?embed=true)
[Xgl](http://en.opensuse.org/Xgl) to work! (Special thanks to
[DavidK-64](http://www.ritter.demon.co.uk) for A: telling me about Xgl
It's really amazing, you just got to
[see](http://www.freedesktop.org/~davidr/xgl-demo1.xvid.avi) for
yourself to get the real impression. The
[compiz](http://en.opensuse.org/Compiz) manager features Wobbling
windows, transparancy, a new "switcher" and a whole lot more. I'm truly
speachless. This is the best eye-candy I've ever experienced. Even
though I'm no fan of windows, It will be interresting to see how
[Vista](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/default.aspx)'s 3D effects
will be, compared to Xgl+compiz... The basic install-steps are really
quite basic -- at least in ubuntu with nvidia:

1.  Install Xgl and compiz\* packages
2.  Start
    [Xgl](http://home.thorsen.pm/linux/xgl/Xgl_start.txt?embed=true) and
    xterm
3.  su -- \<username\>
4.  Start [compiz +
    gnome](http://home.thorsen.pm/linux/xgl/compiz_gnome.txt?embed=true)
5.  Run gconf-editor and configure the
    [plugins](http://home.thorsen.pm/linux/xgl/gconf.png?embed=true)

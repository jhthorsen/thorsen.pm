title: Finally got Nextcloud running with Caddy and php-fpm
---

I've been running [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) for many years, but it has
annoyed me greatly that I had to use Apache to access it, when there's a
[php-fpm](https://hub.docker.com/_/nextcloud/tags?name=fpm) alternative,
and I'm using [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) as my reverse proxy.

My setup involves running both Caddy and Nextcloud as containers, with Podman,
and *not* of Docker.

This is just a quick dump of my Caddyfile, which works with pretty URLs. I'm
quite confident there are some bugs I haven't discovered yet, but it seems to
work very nice for now.

```
nextcloud.example.com {
    # Nextcloud is mounted as /var/www/html in the nextcloud container
    root * /srv/nextcloud
    encode gzip zstd

    # This list is a work in progress. Trying to see if there's more that should be forbidden.
    @forbidden {
        path /.htaccess
        path /.xml
        path /console.php
        path /cron.php
        path /3rdparty/*

        path /occ
        path /occ/*
        path /templates/*
        path /tests/*
    }

    # I'm not sure if this list is needed, but it seems to be faster
    @static {
        not path /index.php*

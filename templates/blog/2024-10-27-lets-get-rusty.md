title: I'm getting rusty
---

I've been using [Perl](https://www.perl.org) and
[Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for about 24 years, and
haven't really used any other programming languages - at least not for creating
applications from the ground up. This makes 2024 a very exciting year for me,
since I have now started using both [Go](https://go.dev) and
[Rust](http://rust-lang.org/) for various types of projects.

## Go

Go feels like just a faster version of [Python](https://www.python.org) though.
It's a very simple language, which is both it's strength and it's weakness:
It's so quick to get started with, but the type system is very basic and
results in a lot of runtime panics, unless you are careful.

The error handling is just sh*t. I don't understand why you would want to
sprinkle three lines of code after every function call, just to make sure your
application does not blow up:

```go
res, err := myAwesomeFunction()
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```

I had this dicussion with a friend some years ago, where the argument was that
you just get the editor to add the if-err-then-return-err-code, but even if I
automate that, I still have to *read* those lines code later on.

I think the worst part of Go are nil-pointers. I really appreciate that the
type system in Rust simply does not allow me run the code below:

```go
func HandlePerson(person *Person) {
    // Going to blow up at some time, since "person" might be nil!
    fmt.Printf("Name: %s\n", person.Name)
}

person_pointer, err := GetPerson(42)
// Ooops! Forgot to check "err"
HandlePerson(person_pointer)
```

Last, the naming convention is... Weird. Forcing the user to start a function
with UpperCase to mark it as public looks like a weird hack, but you get used
to it. At least up until you're start working with JSON, and all the
`snake_case` fields becomes `SnakeCase` in a Go struct. I find that rather
annoying, since you then have to constantly translate between what you read in
an API spec, and what you have to type in your Go program. Because of this, I
don't think I would be able to be effective in Go, without a
[LSP](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/configs.md#gopls).

I'm currently not a huge fan of Go, but it's growing on me.

## Rust

Rust is just amazing. I feel like I've wasted so much time testing
data-structures in Perl, as in "Did I really get the structure that I
expected?". This is not something I have to spend time doing in Rust, since the
types are what they are. It's also a lot more comfortable to work with than Go,
since you have [Option](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/) and
[enums](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html), which
forces you to check for errors, and avoids nil-pointer exceptions.

Error handling is also just wonderful. Have a look at this, compared to the Go
example above:

```rust
res = my_awesome_function()?
```

Just by adding a simple question mark at the end, you can bubble up the error,
that is if your return type allow the error type... It's still really nice
though, and saves me for a lot of typing and reading. The best thing is however
that you can't *forget* to check for errors! In Go, you can just drop the
if-statement and your application will for sure blow up at some point.

Coming from Perl, the speed is just mind-boggling: When I first rewrote my
[webpage](http://github.com/jhthorsen/thorsen.pm) in Rust, I thought I had
introduced some magic caching headers, since the page loaded instantaneous.
I do feel bad thinking about all the extra electricity servers have to use
to render for example a Wordpress site.

There is a lot of syntax in Rust though. It's not like Go, where you can be
learn and get comfortable with the syntax in just a couple of hours. For
example; I still haven't been able to get familiar with the
[explicit lifetime](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime/explicit.html)
in Rust, but at the same time, I was able to rewrite my whole webpage, without
having to worry about. I think this means that Rust has support to do a lot
of powerful things, but you can also (in many cases) opt-out by restructuring
your code in a different way.

I can't wait to write some more Rust.

## Zig?

Haven't gotten around to Zig yet. I'm a bit scared of jumping on the "hype
train", but it looks like it's a serious language, which many people like, so
maybe it would be worth a look? I do however wonder which languages will
disappear, becuase there certainly is a lot of languages now...
